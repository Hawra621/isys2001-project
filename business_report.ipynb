        "The Enron Corporation, established in 1985, was an American energy, services, and commodities company. Although the company had increased market share, with a market value of over $70 billion, there was a dark reality of fraudulent accounting practices and financial scandals (Ali & El Gayar, 2019). The firm used deceptive activity to manipulate its financial statements and inflate its profits. The company's practices involved complex schemes and the creation of off-balance-sheet entities to hide the debt losses. The company collapsed in 2001 after the fraudulent activities were exposed. The Enron scandal also exposed weaknesses in corporate governance and raised concerns about the effectiveness of regulatory oversight. The Enron scandal is a cautionary tale about the importance of transparency, ethical behaivour, and effective corporate governance in the business setting. The scandal highlighted the need for robust internal controls, independent audits, and a culture of integrity within organisations. Analyising the Enron mail dataset, which consists of email communication from the firm's executives, employees, and associates, can provide insights into the company's communication patterns and potentially uncover additional evidence related to scandals. \n",

        " The paper utilizes Enron as the major data source for the general paper analysis. It considers the firm's shortcomings which contributed to the company's collapse. Enron's database served this study with effective evaluation data for the general analysis. The data was also sourced from various text files used during the company's operation. For instance, data was extracted from JSON files, CSV, XML, and plain text files. Other business operation data was acquired from binary files like app data and media files like images, audio, video, and other compiled text.\n",

Also, panda, a Python library, is used for the exploratory portion of the email dataset. However, a mixture of matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas is used to create the visualization.
